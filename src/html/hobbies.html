                    I've always carried the passion for arts ever since I was a little girl.
                    Reading and coming up with my own stories helped me escape reality. 
                    But not only that, I also had an interest for games and computers. 
                    So when I found out I can combine both of my passion and interest, 
                    I took no hesitation to pick the path I have today.
